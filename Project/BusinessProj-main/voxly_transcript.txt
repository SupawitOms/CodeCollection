might soon be hungry as well because we're going to talk about breakfast how important is it let's start by hearing from professor alexandra johnston a nutrition scientist who spoke to ruth alexander host of bbc world service program the food chain i am supporting the meem breakfast like a king and dying like a pauper for you then breakfast is the most important meal of the day i agree so it was really important particularly for people who are trying to maintain a healthy weight and people who are trying to lose lose weight alexandra says that you should breakfast like a king and dine like a

have a question for you fell according to a recent survey which of the following is the most popular breakfast in the u k a is it a x b toast or c serial well i think people like to keep it simple so i'm going to say toast okay well we'll find out the answer later in the program let's hear some reasons for why we should breakfast like a king or queen courtney peterson who researcher is eating behaviours explains how the time of day affects how our bodies process food on bbc world service programme the food chain and so if you can eat a large breakfast in the morning and or i would even say a large lunch in the morning your body is going to be better at metabolizing that food and what that means is your body is going to actually your blood sugar levels won't spike as high you'll you might burn slightly more fat you might burn slightly more calories from eating earlier in the day whereas if you had if you eat mostly your food later in the day your metabolism is actually slower later in the day so for instance if you ate the same i don't know bowl of ice cream in the morning the afternoon in the evening ing your blood sugar levels will spike significantly higher in the afternoon in the evening we heard the noun metabolism this is a word that refers to the chemical processes in your body and we most often use it to talk about those that convert food into energy and we also heard the verb form metabolize courtney talked about blood sugar levels spiking a spike is a sharp pointed shape if you see it on a line graph it means that something has increased very rapidly we often use the noun spike to mean a sudden increase in value that is being measured the verb spike means to suddenly increase we've heard that eating earlier in the day be healthier for us
